# Game Documentation

## Overview

This game is a physics-based, match-3 puzzle game where colored balls drop into columns (tubes) and stack into a grid.  
Players launch balls via a swinging pendulum, aiming to create matches of 3 or more of the same color (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) to clear them for points.  
Strategic placement, timing, and awareness of tube lids and hearts/lives are key to maximizing score and surviving as long as possible.
